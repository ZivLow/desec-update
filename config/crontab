# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# * * * * * command(s)
# | | | | |
# | | | | ----- Day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7)
# | | | ------- Month (1 - 12)
# | | --------- Day of month (1 - 31)
# | ----------- Hour (0 - 23)
# ------------- Minute (0 - 59)
#
# Terminal command to edit crontab jobs:
# $ crontab -e
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command
# desec-update ip of domains
